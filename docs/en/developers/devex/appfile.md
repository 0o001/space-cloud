# Learning Appfile Step by Step

Appfile is the main user interface to configure application deployment on Vela.

In this tutorial, we will build and deploy an example NodeJS app under [examples/testapp/](https://github.com/oam-dev/kubevela/tree/master/docs/examples/testapp).

## Prerequisites

- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on the host

## 1. Download test app code

git clone and go to the testapp directory:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/oam-dev/kubevela.git
$ cd kubevela/docs/examples/testapp
```

The example contains NodeJS app code, Dockerfile to build the app.

## 2. Deploy app in one command

In the directory there is a [vela.yaml](https://github.com/oam-dev/kubevela/tree/master/docs/examples/testapp/vela.yaml) which follows Appfile format supported by Vela.
We are going to use it to build and deploy the app.

**ATTENTION**: change the image field in vela.yaml to something you can push to:

```yaml
    image: oamdev/testapp:v1 # change this to your image
```

Run the following command:

```bash
$ vela up

         Logging: vela logs testapp
      App status: vela status testapp
  Service status: vela status testapp --svc express-server
```


Check the status of the service:

```bash
$ vela status testapp

### Alternative: Local testing without pushing image remotely

If you have local [kind](../../install.md#kind) cluster running, you may try the local push option without pushing image remotely.

Add local option to `build`:

```yaml
    build:
      # push image into local kind cluster without remote transfer
      push:
        local: kind

      docker:
        file: Dockerfile
        context: .
```

Then deploy the app to kind:

```bash
$ vela up
```

<details><summary>(Advanced) Check rendered manifests</summary>

By default, Vela renders the final manifests in `.vela/deploy.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
kind: ApplicationConfiguration
metadata:
  name: testapp
  namespace: default
spec:
  components:
  - componentName: express-server
---
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: express-server
  namespace: default
spec:
  workload:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: express-server
    ...
---
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
kind: HealthScope
metadata:
  name: testapp-default-health
  namespace: default
spec:
  ...
```
</details>

## [Optional] Configure another workload type

By now we have deployed a *webservice* workload. We can also add a *task* workload in appfile:

> Below is a simplified [k8s job example](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/#running-an-example-job) using Vela:

```yaml
services:
  pi:
    image: perl 
    cmd: ["perl",  "-Mbignum=bpi", "-wle", "print bpi(2000)"]

  express-server:
    ...
```

Then deploy appfile again to update the application:

```bash
$ vela up
```

## What's Next?

Congratulations! You have just deployed an app using Vela.

Here are some next steps that you can have more play with your app:

- [Check Application Logs](../check-logs.md)
- [Execute Commands in Container](../exec-cmd.md)
- [Port Forward to Container](../port-forward.md)

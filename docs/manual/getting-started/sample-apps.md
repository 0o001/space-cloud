# Run Sample Apps

Once you've understood the basics on how to create and deploy a project with Space Cloud, it is time to explore the features Space Cloud has to offer. For this very purpose we have created some sample apps using popular web technologies (like React, etc.). In Space Console, we have a feature called `templates` which loads the configurations required for these apps.
